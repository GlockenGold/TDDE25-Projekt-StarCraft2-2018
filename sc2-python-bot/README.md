# StarCraft II Python Bot
This repository contains a passive CommandCenterPy-based bot for StarCraft II. It is intended to be a reasonable starting-point for creating your own StarCraft II-playing system.

## Setup for creating your own bot
1. Start by forking this repository. This will create your own copy of this repository, which can be done by pressing the fork button above. This will bring you to your own version of this page.

2. Now clone your new repository using the following command: `git clone <path>`, where `<path>` is the url to the right of the fork button you just pressed. If you have configured SSH-access, then use the SSH link, otherwise use the HTTP link.

3. Next, setup the library in PyCharm. See [PyCommandCenter's page on PyCharm] for how to do that.

4. Everything is now ready for PyCharm: Start PyCharm, and then select "Open" and navigate to the location you cloned your fork of this repository to.

5. In order to run the code, right click the file named "main.py" in the project panel to the right, and select "Debug main". This will run the code in "main.py", and consequently start StarCraft II. You can also edit the code in "main.py" by double-clicking "main.py".
